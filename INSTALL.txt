Install instructions for Tartini (version 1.3)

To compile Tartini 1.3 from the source:

Step 1.
Build Qt 6.4.1 in static library mode using Visual Studio 2020 on Windows or
qmake on either Windows or Linux.
Build FFTW3=3.3.10 in static library mode (found in the Extras directory)
    Windows:
        1. Modify CMakeLists.txt to turn BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF by default and
           ENABLE_FLOAT on by default
        2. Build by opening the folder in Visual Studio 2020 and building
	   Debug and Release
        3. Manually install the required files debug and release fftw3f.lib
	   and fftw3f.pdb into the respective release directories in
	   (C:\fftw-3.3.10\Debug and C:\fft2-3.3.10\Release on windows)
    Linux:
	1. ./configure --enable-single --prefix=INSTALL_DIR > LOG.configure 2>&1 &
	2. make
	3. make install
	   
Build QWT-6.2.0 in static library mode (found in the Extras directory):
        1. Open a shell that has Qt and your compiler environment in the path
        2. In qwtconfig.pri comment out QwtDLL so that a static library is built
	   and set the QWT_INSTALL_PREFIX so the desired location.
        3. run: qmake qwt.pro
        4. run make (or nmake)
        5. run make install (or nmake install) to install in the location
           defined in qwtconfig.pri

Step 2.
Edit pitch.pro and put the correct library and include paths for your setup.
(for Linux make sure libasound2-dev is loaded)

Step 3.
Open a shell that has Qt and your compiler environment in the path

At the command prompt (from in the directory) type:
  qmake pitch.pro         - This will generate a Makefile
On Linux:
  make all                - This will compile the executable called tartini.
On Windows:
  nmake all               - This will compile the executable called tartini.

You can also build in Visual Studio 2020 using the Qt Visual Studio Tools
extension to create a solution. Then build the desired configuration.
